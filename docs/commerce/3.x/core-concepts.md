# Core Concepts

In the same way Craft CMS provides a platform for flexible content management, Craft Commerce provides a platform for creating custom ecommerce experiences.

It does this by providing...

- [Purchasable elements](products-variants.md) sold via [Carts and Orders](orders-carts.md), with pricing optionally modified by [Adjusters](adjusters.md).
- Additional [customer](customers.md) details for Craftâ€™s [Users](/3.x/users.md) with the ability for guests to smoothly transition to member accounts.
- A checkout flow that can integrate with [payment](payment-gateways.md), [tax](tax.md) and [shipping systems](shipping.md).
- A suite of tools for things like [currency conversion](payment-currencies.md), [sales](sales.md), [discounts](discounts.md), invoice [emails](emails.md) and [PDFs](pdfs.md).
- Exposing [Events](events.md) that can be used to customize functionality.

Because Craft Commerce is built on Craft CMS, most Craft features can be integral to the ecommerce experience:

- Custom fields.
- Localization.
- Powerful relationships, search, and fine-grained permissions.
- Flexible front ends using Twig and/or GraphQL.
