# Address Management

Your customers will need to provide billing and shipping information at some point during [checkout](checkout.md). You can set up this experience in a couple of ways:

- Configuring addresses [on a cart](../system/addresses.md#cart-addresses): Directly add billing and shipping information to the customerâ€™s cart. _For guests, this is the only means of collecting address information!_
- Reusing addresses from an [address book](../system/addresses.md#address-book): See the main Craft documentation for information about [managing address elements](/5.x/reference/element-types/addresses.md) outside the context of a cart.
