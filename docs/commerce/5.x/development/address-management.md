# Address Management

Your customers will need to provide billing and shipping information at some point during [checkout](checkout.md). You can set up this experience in a number of waysâ€”this section covers two: configuring addresses [on a cart](#cart-addresses); and reusing addresses from an [address book](#customer-address-book).

## Cart Addresses

## Customer Address Book

See the main Craft documentation for information about [managing address elements](/5.x/reference/element-types/addresses.md) outside the context of a cart.
