# Fields

Commerce adds two new [relational fields](/5.x/system/relations.md) for you to use in your content model. These fields enable seamless merchandising (embedding products into other content) and support advanced product organization (categorizing or tagging products for browsing and applying [pricing rules](../system/pricing-rules.md)).
