## Why Craft CMS?

Craft is a flexible, user-friendly <abbr title="Content management system">CMS</abbr> for creating custom digital experiences on the web—and beyond.

You have a _ton_ of options when it comes to choosing a CMS. Craft is uniquely equipped to deliver high-quality, content-driven experiences to your clients and their audiences, in large part due to its blank-slate approach to content modeling.

To demonstrate Craft’s agility, we’ll build a basic blog—and in doing so, touch a number of powerful tools that let you design, build, and manage _any_ kind of content.
