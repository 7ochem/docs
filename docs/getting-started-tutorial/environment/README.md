# Local development

Craft is a first and foremost a _web application_, meaning it’s used primarily from a browser over <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>.

Setting up a web server (and some related tools) on our own computer will allow us to freely experiment with Craft. We’ll call this our “local development environment,” from here-on.

The next few pages will get you familiar with:

- The terminal application built into your operating system;
- Your options for a text editor;
- The components of a local web server;
