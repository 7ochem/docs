# Local Development

Craft is a first and foremost a _web application_, meaning it’s used primarily from a browser over <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>.

Setting up a web server (and some related tools) on your own computer will allow you to freely experiment with Craft. We’ll call this your “local development environment,” from here-on.

The next few pages will get you familiar with:

- The [terminal](./terminal.md) application built into your operating system;
- Your options for a [text editor](./editor.md);
- The components of a [local web server](./stack.md);
