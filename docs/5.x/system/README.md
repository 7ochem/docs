Let’s get to know Craft’s core features, starting with your project’s [Directory Structure](directory-structure.md) and the [Control Panel](control-panel.md).

The content in this section is for a variety of audiences, so we expect that you’ll jump around—some of it is geared toward developers (like [Project Config](project-config.md) or [Routing](routing.md)), but other resources will be useful to everyone (like [User Management](user-management.md) and [Relations](relations.md)).
