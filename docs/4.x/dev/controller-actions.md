# Controller Actions

Controllers are Craft’s way of talking to the outside world. Pretty much everything you do with Craft is part of a request that involves a [controller action](guide:structure-controllers)—from updating settings to rendering an entry.

Most controllers and actions are carefully locked down with [permissions](../user-management.md#permissions) to prevent malicious activity, but a select few are necessarily available to logged-in users and “guests” (to support features like [public registration](../user-management.md#public-registration) or [cart management](/docs/commerce/4.x/orders-carts.md)).

To get a sense for the kind of things you can do, jump to the [available actions](#available-actions).

## Making Requests

An “action request” is one that explicitly declares the controller and action to use, via an `action` query or body param. Actions are usually in the 

Craft also supports routing to specific actions using a path defined by the <config4:actionTrigger> setting, or by creating an [alias in `routes.php`](../routing.md#advanced-routing-with-url-rules).

::: tip
This `action` parameter is different from the `<form action="...">` attribute:

- The `action` _param_ should be used within a URL query string (`?action=...`) for `GET` requests, or in the body of a `POST` request.
- The _form attribute_ should only be used when you want a form to submit to a different path than the user is already on. When an `action` param is _not_ present in the request, you can use an “action path” like `action="/actions/users/login"`. This attribute has no effect if a redirect is issued in response to the request!
:::

### HTTP Verbs

Each action usually responds to one [HTTP method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods). Using an unsupported method will throw a <yii2:yii\web\BadRequestHttpException>, and show your [error template](../routing.md#error-templates) with a 400 `statusCode`.

#### `POST`

All `POST` requests are made through forms or [AJAX](#ajax), and require an `action` parameter and CSRF token.

```twig
{# Let your users request a password reset: #}
<form method="post">
    {{ csrfInput() }}
    {{ actionInput('users/send-password-reset-email') }}

    <label for="loginName">Username or email</label>
    <input type="text" name="loginName" id="loginName">

    <button>Request</button>
</form>
```

Some `POST` requests will write [flashes](#flashes) into the session to communicate successes and failures.

::: tip
Flashes are _not_ set when using [AJAX](#ajax). Look for errors in the response!
:::

#### `GET`

`GET` requests are made by accessing an action URL by way of a regular anchor tag, a form submission, or AJAX. In the [examples](#available-actions) that follow, `GET` action requests are much less common than `POST`, as the bulk of read-only request routing is handled for you, out of the box.

::: code
```twig Anchor/Link
{# Output a “log out” link: #}
<a href="{{ actionUrl('users/logout') }}">Log Out</a>

{# Craft actually provides a shortcut for this: #}
<a href="{{ logoutUrl }}">Log Out</a>
```
```twig Form
{# Pass any element to this (as a Twig partial) to get a CP edit link: #}
<form>
    {{ actionInput('elements/redirect') }}
    {{ hiddenInput('elementId', object.id) }}

    <button>Edit</button>
</form>
```
```js AJAX
// Get info about the current session (guests) and user (if logged in):
fetch('/actions/users/session-info', {
    headers: {
        'Accept': 'application/json',
    },
})
    .then(r => r.json())
    .then(console.log);
// -> { isGuest: true, timeout: 0, csrfTokenValue: '...' }
```
:::

::: tip
You may notice that the `actionUrl()` function generates URLs with `index.php` visible, despite your <config4:omitScriptNameInUrls> setting. This is intended, as it guarantees compatibility with all environments, regardless of configuration.

If you need a cleaner URL, consider setting up a custom [route](../routing.md#advanced-routing-with-url-rules).
:::

### CSRF

Craft has built-in [Cross-Site Request Forgery](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf) mitigation, and therefore requires a valid session and token any time data is submitted via a controller action.

For requests generated by an HTML `<form>`, use the `csrfInput()` [Twig helper](#form-helpers):

```twig
<form method="post">
    {{ csrfInput() }}
    {{ actionInput('entries/save-entry) }}

    {# ... #}
</form>
```

The process is slightly more complicated for [AJAX](#ajax) requests, but can be abstracted in a manner appropriate for your project.

### Form Helpers

Craft has a number of built-in Twig functions to make dealing with forms and input easier.

Function | Notes
-------- | -----
[actionInput()](./functions.md#actioninput) | Generate a hidden HTML `<input>` element for controlling which action a `<form>` should route to.
[actionUrl()](./functions.md#actionurl) | Generate an absolute URL to the specified action, with any extra params. <badge vertical="baseline" type="verb">GET</badge> only.
[csrfInput()](./functions.md#csrfinput) | Generate a hidden HTML `<input>` required for CSRF protection.
[failMessageInput()](./functions.md#failmessageinput) | Override error-condition flash messages. <badge vertical="baseline" type="verb">POST</badge> only.
[hiddenInput()](./functions.md#hiddeninput) | Lower-level helper for generating hidden HTML inputs.
[input()](./functions.md#input) | Even finer-grained control over HTML `<input>` element creation.
[redirectInput()](./functions.md#redirectinput) | Generates a hidden HTML `<input>` element to control redirection after successful requests. <badge vertical="baseline" type="verb">POST</badge> only.
[successMessageInput()](./functions.md#successmessageinput) | Override success-condition flash messages. <badge vertical="baseline" type="verb">POST</badge> only.

### AJAX

In order to respond appropriately, Craft requires that AJAX requests are identified as such. Some tools (like jQuery) need no configuration; others (like the native [`fetch()` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch)) will need to be configured explicitly:

Header | Notes
------ | -----
`Accept` | Set to `application/json` to receive a JSON response (when available).
`X-Requested-With` | Set to `XMLHttpRequest` if your templates rely on `craft.app.request.isAjax`.
`X-CSRF-Token` | Send a valid CSRF token (for POST requests) if none is provided in the request body under the key determined by <config4:csrfTokenName>.
`Content-Type` | Set to `application/json` if the [request’s body](guide:runtime-requests#request-parameters) is a serialized JSON payload (as opposed to `FormData`).

A CSRF token is still required for AJAX requests using the `POST` method. You can ensure a session is started (for guests) by preflighting a request to the `users/session-info` action:

```js
// Helper for fetching a CSRF token:
const getSessionInfo = function() {
    return fetch('/actions/users/session-info', {
        headers: {
            'Accept': 'application/json',
        },
    })
        .then(r => r.json());
};

// Session info is passed to the chained handler:
getSessionInfo()
    .then(session => {
        const params = new FormData();

        // Read the User’s ID from the session data (assuming they’re logged in):
        params.append('userId', session.id);
        params.append('fullName', 'Tony Tiger');

        return fetch('/actions/users/save-user', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
                'Accept': 'application/json',
                'X-CSRF-Token': session.csrfTokenValue,
                'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest',
                // If `params` is a JSON-encoded payload,
                // also set `Content-Type`!
            },
            body: params,
        });
    })
    .then(r => r.json())
    .then(console.log);
```

This example assumes you have no preexisting HTML from the server (as though it was part of a [headless](config4:headlessMode) application). If you are working on a hybrid front-end (and sprinkling interactivity into primarily server-rendered pages), you could eliminate the first request by stashing the User’s ID and CSRF token in the document’s `<head>` (or on a relevant element) and reading it with Javascript:

```twig
<button
    id="update-name"
    data-user-id="{{ currentUser.id }}"
    data-csrf-token-value="{{ craft.app.request.getCsrfToken() }}"
    data-csrf-token-name="{{ craft.app.config.general.csrfTokenName }}">Edit Name</button>

<script>
    const $button = document.getElementById('update-name');

    $button.addEventListener('click', function(e) {
        const params = new FormData();

        params.append('userId', $button.dataset.userId);
        params.append($button.dataset.csrfTokenName, $button.dataset.csrfTokenValue);
        params.append('fullName', prompt('New name:'));

        fetch('/actions/users/save-user', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
                'Accept': 'application/json',
                'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest',
            },
            body: params,
        });
    });
</script>
```

### Models and Validation

A lot of the data creation and manipulation we’ll cover in the examples below revolve around <yii2:yii\base\Model>s. Craft uses Models to store and validate all kinds of things—including every type of [element](../elements.md) you’re already familiar with!

If you encounter errors when creating or saving something, it will usually be passed back to your template as a special variable like `entry` or `user`, and a [flash](#flashes) will be set. Every model has a `.getErrors()` method that returns a list of messages for any attribute (or custom field) that did not validate.

While abbreviated, this “user profile” form contains all the patterns required to display contextual validation errors:

::: code
```twig account.twig
{% extends '_layouts/default' %}

{# Require an active user session: #}
{% requireLogin %}

{% block content %}
    {# Display the user’s saved name: #}
    <h1>Hello, {{ currentUser.fullName }}</h1>

    {# Normalize the `user` variable, so we can use it in the form regardless of whether or not it was rendered following a submission attempt: #}
    {% set user = user ?? currentUser %}

    <form method="post">
        {{ csrfInput() }}
        {{ actionInput('users/save-user') }}
        {{ hiddenInput('userId', user.id) }}

        <label for="fullName">Full Name</label>

        {{ input('text', 'fullName', user.fullName, {
            id: 'fullName',
            aria: {
                errormessage: user.hasErrors('fullName') ? 'fullName-errors',
            },
        }) }}

        {% if user.hasErrors('fullName') %}
            <ul>
                {% for error in user.getErrors('fullName') %}
                    <li>{{ error }}</li>
                {% endfor %}
            </ul>
        {% endif %}

        {# ...other fields and attributes... #}

        <button>Save</button>
    </form>
{% endblock %}
```
```twig _layouts/default.twig
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="{{ currentSite.language }}">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>{{ siteName }} — Account</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        {# Output flashes in a global space: #}
        {% set flashes = craft.app.session.getAllFlashes(true) %}

        {% if flashes | length %}
            {% for type, flash in flashes %}
                <p class="{{ type }}" role="alert">{{ flash }}</p>
            {% endfor %}
        {% endif %}

        {% block content null %}
    </body>
</html>
```
:::

The same principles apply to anything else you want to make editable in the front-end, so long as the user has the correct permissions. Take a look at the [public registration forms](kb:front-end-user-accounts) for some examples of validation on forms available to guests—and to learn about some nice abstractions that will help reduce repetition in your form markup!

#### Flashes

Flashes are temporary messages Craft stores in your session, typically under keys corresponding to their severity, like `notice` or `error`. You can output flashes in your templates:

```twig
{# Retrieve + clear all flashes: #}
{% set flashes = craft.app.session.getAllFlashes(true) %}

{% if flashes | length %}
    {% for type, flash in flashes %}
        <p class="{{ type }}">{{ flash }}</p>
    {% endfor %}
{% endif %}
```

::: tip
See the [Entry Form](https://craftcms.com/knowledge-base/entry-form) guide for an example of working with this action.
:::

::: warning
Note that _all_ custom fields can updated by users. For this reason, you should not assume that custom fields are protected from modification simply because they are omitted from the form.

Similarly, if you are outputting user-submitted content anywhere on site, take special care to prevent yourself or other users from being exposed to [XSS vulnerabilities](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/)!

## Plugins + Custom Actions

Many plugins expose functionality via their own controllers and actions. Their accepted parameters and response types are entirely up to the author, but the [fundamentals](#making-requests) will be the same. Consult the appropriate documentation for specifics!

Here are some examples in our own plugins:

- [Commerce](https://plugins.craftcms.com/commerce): A variety of cart management capabilities are provided for users and guests.
- [Contact Form](https://plugins.craftcms.com/contact-form): Adds the `contact-form/send` action for processing submissions and delivering notifications.
- [Element API](https://plugins.craftcms.com/element-api): Customizable routes get mapped to queries, and return JSON representations of elements.

Custom modules can also provide actions via a [Controller](../extend/controllers.md).
