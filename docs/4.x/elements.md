# Elements

An _element_ is the most basic unit of content in Craft.

In the control panel, you’ll encounter the eight _element types_ common to all Craft installations:

- [**Assets**](assets.md) store files that are uploaded to a volume.
- [**Categories**](categories.md) are taxonomies that resemble folder structures and can be nested.
- [**Entries**](entries.md) are records that can have drafts, revisions, and live previews. They can exist as one-offs called “Singles,” ordered by one or more attributes in “Channels,” or organized hierarchically as “Structures.”
- [**Global Sets**](globals.md) are floating bits of content that aren’t tied to any particular page or other piece of content, ideal for bits of information you might want to show on every page of your site.
- [**Matrix Blocks**](matrix-blocks.md) are powerful, repeating groupings of content that can be used within the other element types.
- [**Tags**](tags.md) are flat taxonomies optimized for quick input and re-use.
- [**Users**](users.md) are accounts for human beings with email addresses and permissions, organized into customizable groups.
- [**Addresses**](addresses.md) are physical addresses that can be attached to users.

Choosing the appropriate element type for your content model is essential—but don’t be afraid to mix, match, and combine them.

Some features are available to all elements:

Since this is a web-based content management system, often an element will include a unique URL. It may involve text, imagery, important relationships to other content, variations by language or site, or drafts that aren’t ready to be published.

There’s no limit to how many element types you use or how you combine them. You can use third-party plugins or write your own to include additional element types.

While each element type is unique in some way, it’s important to know that **all** elements are made up of their own [custom fields](fields.md) that determine exactly what content should be collected and stored.
