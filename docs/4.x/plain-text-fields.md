# Plain Text Fields

Plain Text fields give you either a normal text input or a multi-line textarea, where plain text can be entered.

## Settings

Plain Text fields have the following settings:

- **UI Mode** – How the field should be presented in the control panel. (Defaults to “Normal”, can be “Enlarged”.)
- **Placeholder Text** – The field’s placeholder text, to be displayed if the field has no value yet.
- **Field Limit** – The maximum number of characters or bytes the field is allowed to have. (Accepts a number and a unit, which defaults to “Characters” with another option for “Bytes”.)
- **Use a monospaced font** – Whether field contents should be displayed in a monospaced font.
- **Allow line breaks** – Whether to allow line breaks in this field.

## The Field

Plain Text fields will either show a normal text input or a multi-line textarea, depending on whether **Allow line breaks** was checked.

## Development

Calling a Plain Text field in your templates will return the value that was entered in the field.
