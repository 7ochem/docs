# Project Setup

## Adding Sites

To add a site to Nitro, three things need to happen:

- The web server within your Nitro machine needs to be configured to serve your site.
- Your system‚Äôs `hosts` file needs to be updated to associate your site‚Äôs hostname with Nitro.

### Add a site with `nitro add`

If your project files are completely contained within a single folder, then you can quickly accomplish these using
the [`add`](#add) command:

```bash
$ cd /path/to/project
$ nitro add
Adding site‚Ä¶
Enter the hostname [mysite.test]:
  ‚úì setting hostname to mysite.test
  ‚úì adding site ~/dev/support/mysite.test
Enter the webroot for the site [web]:
  ‚úì using webroot web
Choose a PHP version:
  1. 8.0
  2. 7.4
  3. 7.3
  4. 7.2
  5. 7.1
  6. 7.0
Enter your selection: 2
  ‚úì setting PHP version 7.4

```

### Mounting your entire dev folder at once

If you manage all of your projects within a single dev folder, you can mount that entire folder once within Nitro, and point your sites‚Äô web roots to the appropriate directroy and webroot within it.

To do that, open your `~/.nitro/nitro.yaml` file in a text editor (or run the [`edit`](commands.md#edit) command), and add a multiple sites with the same `path` as your `~/dev` folder. The webroot for each site should be the `folder-name/web` to route HTTP requests properly:

```yaml
sites:
 - hostname: example1.test
   path: ~/dev
   webroot: example1.test/web
   version: "7.4"
   xdebug: false
 - hostname: example2.test
   path: ~/dev
   webroot: example2.test/web
   version: "7.4"
   xdebug: false
```

Then run `nitro apply` to apply your `nitro.yaml` changes to the machine.

::: tip
If you have a large amount of files in the `~/dev` folder, it may be more performant to mount site individually using `nitro add`.
:::

::: warning
If your projects contain any symlinks, such as `path` Composer repositories, those symlinks **must** be relative (`../`), not absolute (`/` or `~/`).
:::

## Connecting to the Database

To connect to the machine from a Craft install, set the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

```
DB_USER="nitro"
DB_PASSWORD="nitro"
# `nitro` is the default database
DB_DATABASE="nitro"
```

To connect to the database from your host operating system, you‚Äôll first need to get the IP address of your Nitro machine. You can find that by running the [info](#info) command.

```
$ nitro info
Name:           nitro-dev
State:          Running
IPv4:           192.168.64.2
Release:        Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
Image hash:     2f6bc5e7d9ac (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
Load:           0.71 0.74 0.60
Disk usage:     2.7G out of 38.6G
Memory usage:   526.4M out of 3.9G
```

Then from your SQL client of choice, create a new database connection with the following settings:

- **Host**: _The `IPv4` value from `nitro info`_
- **Port**: _The port you configured your database with (3306 for MySQL or 5432 for PostgreSQL by default)._
- **Username**: `nitro`
- **Password**: `nitro`

## Adding a Database

Nitro creates its initial `nitro` database for you. You can add as many databases as you‚Äôd like running the following command, which will prompt for your desired database engine and name:

```bash
$ nitro db add
```

## Adding Multiple Database Engines

To run multiple database engines on the same machine, open your `~/.nitro/nitro-dev.yaml` file in a text editor (or
run the [`edit`](commands.md#edit) command), and list additional databases under the `databases` key:

```yaml
databases:
 - engine: mysql
   version: "5.7"
   port: "3306"
 - engine: mysql
   version: "5.6"
   port: "33061"
 - engine: postgres
   version: "11"
   port: "5432"
```

::: warning
Each database engine needs its own unique port.
:::

Run `nitro apply` to apply your `nitro.yaml` changes to the machine.
