# Installation

## Installing Nitro

### macOS and Linux

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (requires 3.0.0+).

    ```bash
    bash <(curl -sLS http://installer.getnitro.sh)
    ```

3. Follow the prompts to create your machine.

// TODO Update WINDOWS
### Windows 10

::: tip
Windows doesnâ€™t currently have an automated install script, so installation and updating must be done manually.
:::

1. Install [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
2. Download `nitro_windows_x86_64.zip` from the latest [release](https://github.com/craftcms/nitro/releases)
3. Create a `Nitro` folder in your home folder, if it does not exist. i.e. `C:\Users\<username>\Nitro`
4. Extract the zip file and copy `nitro.exe` into the `Nitro` folder you just created in your home folder.
5. If this is your first installation, run this from the command line to add `nitro` to your global path: `setx path "%PATH%;%USERPROFILE%\Nitro"`
6. Start the Windows terminal (cmd.exe) with Administrator permissions and run `nitro init` to create your first machine.

Once complete, you will run the command `nitro init` and be prompted for some default options, and a new configuration file for Nitro stored at `~/.nitro/nitro.yaml`.

## Uninstalling Nitro

To completely remove Nitro, first [destroy](commands.md#destroy) your machine:

```bash
nitro destroy
```

:::

Then remove your `nitro` command:

::: code
```bash macOS and Linux
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/nitro
```
```bash Windows
rm -rf $HOME/Nitro
```
:::

You can optionally remove your Nitro config as well:

::: code
```bash macOS and Linux
rm -rf ~/.nitro
```
```bash Windows
rm -rf $HOME/.nitro
```
