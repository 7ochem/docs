# Upgrading from Nitro 1

Nitro 2 is built on Docker instead of Multipass and nearly everything has changed under the hood.

To upgrade, youâ€™ll need to do the following:

1. Back up your databases.
2. Uninstall Nitro 1 (and optionally Multipass).
3. Install Nitro 2.
4. Re-add each site and import its related database.

## Back Up Databases
