# Backing Up Databases

Nitro provides a handy way to backup a database using the [`db backup`](commands.md#db-backup).

To backup an existing database, run the following command:

```bash
$ nitro db backup
```

If you have more than one database engine you will be prompted to select an engine, otherwise it will default to the first engine.

```bash
Getting ready to backupâ€¦
Which database engine?
  1. mysql-8.0-3306.database.nitro
  2. postgres-13-5432.database.nitro
Enter your selection: 2
```

::: tip
Nitro supports [multiple database](multiple-databases.md) versions of the same type and/or version to run at the same time.

Nitro will now look at all of the available databases and prompt you to select which database to backup:

```bash
Which database should we backup?
  1. postgres
  2. nitro
  3. plugins
Enter your selection: 3
```

Nitro will perform a backup of the database and save it to your host machines `~/.nitro/backups` directory:

```bash
Preparing backupâ€¦
  â€¦ creating backup plugins-2021-01-31-160219.sql âœ“
Backup saved in /Users/oli/.nitro/backups/postgres-13-5432.database.nitro ðŸ’¾
```
